As a **user** I want to **import test data**.
```python
>>> import test_data.zoo
>>> test_data.zoo.geese # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(< grace, the goose that likes < penny the fat penguin > >, 
 < gale, the goose that likes < prince the cool penguin > >,
 < ginger, the goose that likes < puck the boring penguin > >)

```
